# RideMentor ðŸš€  
**Smart Motorcycle Trip Planning, Powered by AI**

Welcome to the **public development hub** for **RideMentor** â€“ an AI-driven app designed to take the stress out of planning motorcycle trips. Whether you're riding solo for a day or planning a scenic multi-day adventure, RideMentor helps generate curated routes based on your preferences, timeframe, and style of travel.

This repository is where weâ€™re **building in public** â€“ sharing ideas, gathering feedback, and collaborating with the motorcycle community as we bring the app to life.
